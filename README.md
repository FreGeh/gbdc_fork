# GBDC: Global Benchmark Database, C++ Extension Module

[![Build-Test](https://github.com/Udopia/gbdc/actions/workflows/build_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Udopia/gbdc/actions/workflows/build_test.yml)

[GBDC](https://github.com/Udopia/gbdc) provides efficient implementations of functions for benchmark instance identification, instance feature extraction and instance transformation.
GBDC provides a command-line tool as well as the Python package `gbdc`.
The Python package `gbdc` is used by [Global Benchmark Database](https://github.com/Udopia/gbd).

## [Documentation](https://udopia.github.io/gbdc/doc/Index.html)

GBDC provides benchmark instance identifiers, feature extractors, and instance transformers for several problem domains, including propositional satisfiability (SAT) and optimization (MaxSAT), as well as Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO).
A description of the supported domains, feature extractors, and instance transformers can be found in the [documentation](https://udopia.github.io/gbdc/doc/Index.html).

## Installation from PyPI
* Pre-built distributions for Linux and MacOS.
* Requires at least Python 3.8.0 (3.10.0 for Apple Silicon).
* Installation via `pip install gbdc`

## Installation from Source

* GBDC uses `libarchive` for reading from a large variety of compressed formats (in some systems provided by the package `libarchive-dev`).
* Some GBDC functions use an [IPASIR](https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir) SAT Solver. GBDC's build-system pulls the external SAT Solver [CaDiCaL](http://fmv.jku.at/cadical/) by A. Biere (MIT licensed).

### Steps:
1. **Install Dependencies** (libarchive, pybind, ninja)
   - For Ubuntu: `apt install libarchive-dev pybind11-dev ninja-build`
   - For macOS: `brew install libarchive pybind11 ninja`

2. Run `pip install . --user` in the repository directory.
<!-- #### Shipped Dependencies

* A copy of the command-line argument parser by P. S. Kumar [`argparse.h`](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse) (MIT licensed) resides in the `lib` folder.

* A copy of the [MD5 hash](https://github.com/CommanderBubble/MD5) implementation by M. Lloyd (MIT licensed) resides in the `lib` folder. -->
